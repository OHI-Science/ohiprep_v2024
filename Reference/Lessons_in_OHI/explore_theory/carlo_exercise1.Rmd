### OHI score models and data

1.  What is the difference between a goal's "status" and "score"?

**There are two statuses, present and future, which are averaged to
create a goal score.**

2.  If a region's food provision goal has the following values, what
    would its food provision score be?

Predicted future status: 80

Current status: 60

**Food Provision Goal Score: 63**

3.  Given the following data, what would this region's Index score be?

| Goal/subgoal                      | Abbreviation | Score |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------|
| Artisanal Fishing Opportunity     | AO           | 90    |
| Habitat                           | HAB          | 50    |
| Species Condition                 | SPP          | 30    |
| Carbon Storage                    | CS           | 20    |
| Clean Waters                      | CW           | 95    |
| Coastal Livelihoods and Economies | LE           | 60    |
| Coastal Protection                | CP           | 80    |
| Food Provision                    | FP           | 85    |
| Natural Products                  | NP           | 100   |
| Sense of Place                    | SP           | 10    |
| Tourism and Recreation            | TR           | 50    |

NOTE: The abbreviations for subgoals have 3 letters and goals have 2
letters.

Super handy that subgoals have 3 letters, that is helpful.

Average all the subgoals to make goal scores. Add up all the goal scores
and take the average.

```{r}
# add and average
(90 + (50 + 30)/2 + 20 + 95 + 60 + 80 + 85 + 100 + 10 + 50)/10
```

4.  Fill in the missing values.

NOTE: Pressure and resilience must be multiplied by 0.01. Trend and
status are not modified.

| Dimension               | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |
|-------------------------|------------|------------|
| Score                   | 71.25      | 77.5       |
| Current status          | 75         | 75         |
| Predicted future status | 67.5       | 80         |
| Trend                   | 0.10       | 0.10       |
| Pressure                | 100        | 50         |
| Resilience              | 50         | 50         |

QUESTION: How did a pressure change from 100 to 50 affect the final
score? Was this a larger or smaller effect than you would have expected?

**The difference in pressure made the final score either over or under
the current status score. I think this effect is about where I would
expect it to be. I hope we have a similar exercise interacting with the
trend.**

```{r}
# set variables
current_1 <- 75
current_2 <- 75

pred_future_2 <- 80

trend <- .1

pressure <- 100 * .01

resilience <- 50 * .01

beta <- 2/3

# transcribed equation for calculating the predicted future
pred_future_1 <- ((1 + beta * trend) + ((1 - beta) * (resilience - pressure))) * current_1 

score_1 <- (current_1 + pred_future_1)/2

# average current and predicted future
score_2 <- (current_2 + pred_future_2)/2

d <- score_2 - score_1
```

### Humans as part of the ecosystem

<br> 5. To calculate the Fishery subgoal, we:

a.  Obtain B/Bmsy scores for each stock that is harvested. B/Bmsy is
    defined as: the ratio of observed biomass to the biomass that would
    provide maximum sustainable yield. When B/BMSY = 1, then biomass
    equals BMSY. If B/BMSY falls below 1, biomass is too low to provide
    maximum sustainable yield. For example, if B/BMSY = 0.5, then
    biomass is only 50% of that needed for maximum sustainable yield.
    (from:
    <http://www.catchshareindicators.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/NE_Biomass_Feb-2014.pdf>)

b.  Convert B/Bmsy into a stock status score that ranges from 0-1, with
    one reflecting a perfect score. The relationship between B/Bmsy
    values and stock status scores looks like this:

![](figures/fis_methods.png)

c.  Take some sort of average of the stock status scores within each
    region (for the global we use a geometric mean weighted by catch).

QUESTION: B/Bmsy scores greater than 1 indicate the stock is doing well,
but is underharvested! Given this, do you think we should penalize
underharvesting? Why? Do you have any ideas for how we could account for
underharvesting without unduly penalizing regions that are trying to let
stocks recover?

**In a general sense, I think it is good to reward fisheries to
maintaining a maximal sustainable harvest. For fisheries that are not
letting their stocks recover from over fishing or other impact then yes,
I do think there should be a slight penalty. This is because, in theory,
the fishery is not maximizing it's utility so their score should not be
the maximum score.**

**The true difficulty with the recovery scenario is that OHI does not
have the ability to know what is going on in the fishery and what the
correct response from fishery management should be. We trust the Bmsy
score, but if you are attempting to let the fishery recover after some
shock then harvesting at that level would be harmful and we would be
rewarding mismanagement by using Bmsy in that case. Does Bmsy update
based on shocks to fisheries? It's easy to point fingers at other
people.**

**So if we had to address this internally, in theory, we could give a
penalty reduction to regions that over harvested before if they are
under harvesting now, that could account for the scenario where
overfishing led to a collapse and they were attempting to regenerate the
fishery. But this technique would not account for environmental
disasters like heat waves or oil spills. They the oceanic conavayer belt
stops, I assume all fisheries would have to reset and harvest less due
to the shock. I look forward to hearing from OHI if that happens.**

<br> <br>

### Gapfilling

6.  Imagine you are calculating OHI scores for 10 regions. The data you
    can find for an economic variable that is used to calculate the
    status of one of the goals looks like this:

| rgn_id | data |
|--------|------|
| 1      | 72   |
| 2      | 74   |
| 3      | 80   |
| 4      | 70   |
| 5      | NA   |
| 6      | NA   |
| 7      | 71   |
| 8      | 75   |
| 9      | 76   |
| 10     | 76   |

QUESTION: Should the missing values (NA is a missing value in R) remain
missing? If so, why?

Or, should you try to estimate the missing values? If so, how might you
go about estimating them?

**I think OHI's policy to store the original data, fill the data gab,
document how the gap was filled and compute with interpolated data.\
\
The interpolation can be done many ways:**

-   **Temporal rolling average**

-   **Similar country average**

-   **Outside data and research**

### Goal status and trend

<br>

7.  Read the methods section for the Lasting Special Places subgoal:
    hhttps://oceanhealthindex.org/images/htmls/Supplement.html#692_Lasting_special_places\_(subgoal_of_sense_of_place))

The information in this section describes how status and trend are
calculated for this goal, it also includes the data used to calculate
the pressure and resilience dimensions.

QUESTION: What is the reference point for this subgoal?

**30% of coastal area protected status**

Explore the links to the pressures and resilience data layers.

Follow this link to the functions.R file in ohi-global:
<https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/functions.R>

Find the Lasting Special Places function. See if you can reconcile the
model described in the Methods with the code. (NOTE: Just aim for a
large picture overview...at this point you do not need to understand
every step....or even most of this)

<br> <br>

8.  The trend for the Tourism and Recreation goal for the United States
    is -0.15. Describe what this means.

**This means that in five years, we expect the US's TR goal score to be
15% less than it is now. We get this by looking at scores from the past
five years and using linear regression to project out 5 years.**

<br> <br>

9.  We are going to walk through a trend calculation. If R is installed
    on your computer, follow along.

Status data for a region's Tourism and Recreation goal:

| Year | Status |
|------|--------|
| 2010 | 72     |
| 2011 | 71     |
| 2012 | 72     |
| 2013 | 73     |
| 2014 | 77     |
| 2015 | 80     |
| 2016 | 82     |

*STEP 1* Estimate the average change per year using a linear regression
model

![](figures/trend_lm.jpg)

The 0.027 value is the slope estimate, which is the average change in
status per year estimated by the linear model.

*STEP 2* Obtain proportional change by dividing the slope estimate by
the earliest status value used in the linear model:

`0.027/0.72 = 0.0375`

There has been nearly a 4% increase in status per year.

*STEP 3* The goal is to predict the change in 5 years, so we multiply
the yearly proportional change by 5:

`0.0375 * 5 = 0.1875`

Status is predicted to increase about 19% in 5 years.

In 2021, status is predicted to be (ignoring pressure/resilience
dimensions): 82 \* (1 + 0.1875) = 97

QUESTION: What assumptions are we making by using this formulation of
trend to calculate the likely future status?

**We assume that the trend is a linear one which is likely not the case
but it is a good estimate. It also assumes that pressures and resilience
are balanced.**

QUESTION: Can you think of any scenarios when we would not use 5 years
of data to estimate trend?

**We may be missing data and unable to use 5 years or some data is not
collected annually.**

### Goal pressure and resilience

<br>

10. The pressure dimension plays a relatively small role in goal scores
    (see figure 4.1), but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data!

The final pressure dimension is calculated for each region and goal
using a function from the ohicore package. The function requires several
pieces of information:

a.  A data layer for each pressure layer describing the magnitude of the
    pressure on a scale of 0-1. For example, here is the sea surface
    temperature pressure layer (low pressures are good and high
    pressures are bad):
    <https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/blob/gh-pages/globalprep/prs_sst/v2022/output/sst_updated.csv>

b.  Classifying the pressure category for each data layer. The pressure
    dimension is based on two types of pressures: Ecological and Social
    (Figure 4.2). The ecological pressures are broken into 5 categories
    (pollution, alien species, habitat destruction, fishing, and climate
    change). Each pressure data layer is assigned to a category in this
    file:
    <https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/pressure_categories.csv>

QUESTION: How many climate change pressures are there?

**4 pressures: cc_sst (sea surface temperature), cc_acid (ocean
acidification), cc_uv (UV radiation), cc_slr (sea level rise)**

c.  Pressure x goal weighting. Pressures have little or no effect on
    some goals, but huge effects on others. The relationship between the
    goals and the pressure variables is described here:
    <https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/pressures_matrix.csv>

QUESTION: Which pressure layers affect the FIS subgoal?

**"po_chemicals", "po_nutrients", "sp_alien", "sp_genetic",
"hd_subtidal_sb", "hd_subtidal_hb", "hd_intertidal", "fp_com_hb",
"fp_com_lb", "fp_art_lb", "fp_art_hb", "ss_wgi", "ss_spi"**

How many regulatory pressure layers are there?

**There are 12 regulatory pressure layers if social layers are the only
other category.**

How many social layers are there?

**There are 2 social layers.**

Which is more important: Ecological or Social pressures?

**They are weighted the same.**

```{r}
pressures <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/eez/conf/pressures_matrix.csv") 

pressure_fis <- pressures %>%
  filter(goal == "FIS") %>% 
  select(where(~ !any(is.na(.))))

colnames(pressure_fis)
```

QUESTION: Some goals, like Coastal Protection, have multiple "elements".
Why?

Goals can have multiple elements because of subcategories like different
habitats. This lets us taylor a goal to a region. Each element is ranked
on its protective strength.

NOTE: It is convention to add a superscript to the pressure name that
describes its category: \* po=pollution \* hd=habitat destruction \*
sp=alien species \* fp=fishing pressure \* cc=climate change

<br> <br>

11. Similar to the pressures dimension, resilience plays a relatively
    small role in goal scores (see figure 4.1) but still takes a lot of
    effort.

The final pressure dimension is calculated for each region and goal
using a function from the ohicore package. The function requires several
pieces of information:

a.  A data layer for each pressure layer describing the magnitude of the
    pressure on a scale of 0-1. For example, here is the Social Progress
    Index layer (low resilience is bad and high resilience is good):
    <https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/blob/gh-pages/globalprep/prs_res_spi/v2022/output/spi_res.csv>

b.  The resilience dimension includes two major categories: Ecological
    and Social (Figure 4.3). Ecological resilience has two
    subcategories: Ecosystem and Regulatory. Regulatory is comprised of
    the same 5 subcomponents as the Ecological *pressures*: pollution,
    alien species, habitat destruction, fishing, and climate change.
    There is also a "goal" specific subcomponent. Each resilience data
    layer is assigned to a category in this file:
    <https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/resilience_categories.csv>

c.  The relationship between goals and resilience is described here:
    <https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/resilience_matrix.csv>
